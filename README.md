# KU Blockchain Institute DAO README

The KU Blockchain Institute DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization focused on providing a platform for its members to contribute and participate in various tasks and events. This README outlines the key features of the DAO, the hybrid tokenomics model, and instructions on how to join.

## Key Features

1. **Task Manager:** The task manager allows members to claim and complete tasks while storing the data on IPFS. Upon completion of tasks, members are automatically rewarded with KUBIX participation tokens.
2. **NFT Gating:** NFTs are used to manage membership and grant privileges such as claiming tasks, creating tasks, and reviewing completed tasks. There are two types of NFTs: Membership NFTs and Executive NFTs.
Leaderboard: A leaderboard displays user rankings based on their total KUBIX tokens and the number of tasks completed.
3. **User Page:** The user page allows people with a valid KU email address to join the DAO and displays user information, including KUBIX balance and tasks completed.
KUBI Direct Democracy Coin: The DAO includes a voting mechanism using the KUBI Direct Democracy Coin, but the voting features have not been set up yet.

## Hybrid Tokenomics Model

The hybrid tokenomics model combines token burning, exponential burn over time, incentive, and privilege systems. Members who participate in events and complete tasks can earn KUBIX tokens, which can be used to unlock merchandise, discounts, and other benefits.

###Distribution Rubric
The KUBIX distribution is based on a formula that takes into account the task's difficulty, estimated hours, and a base KUBIX value:

**BaseKUBIX + (DifficultyMultiplier * EstimatedHours) = TotalKUBIX (rounded to whole number)**

### Merchandise and Tiers
Members can unlock merchandise at different KUBIX levels without spending their KUBIX tokens. When a member unlocks merchandise, they receive an NFT certificate for the merchandise and an NFT to indicate their tier achievement for that year.
